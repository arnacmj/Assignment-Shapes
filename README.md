# Assignment
Complete the `run.php` script so it outputs the **total area** and **total volume** for the array of shapes. The shapes are both 2D and 3D.

### To Do
- Create a [cube](http://www.deke.com/files/images/blog-20130723-DT%20cube/07-cube.jpg) object and a [sphere](http://orig14.deviantart.net/bd2a/f/2014/077/1/d/sphere__10__by_clipartcotttage-d7ar4gc.png) object.
- Add the cube and sphere to the `run.php` script.
- The **total area** is the sum for the area of each shape.
- The **total volume** is the sum for the volume of each **3D shape**. Ignore 2D shapes from the array.
- Create PHPUnit tests for each class in the `src` directory.
