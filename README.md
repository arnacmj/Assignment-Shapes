# Coding Assignments

Complete the following coding assignments in a reasonable time frame to show your competence with SOLID principles, 
unit testing and logical problem solving.

All tests come pre-packaged with an installation of the *Lumen* framework. Documentation and requirements for 
the framework can be found on the [Lumen website](https://lumen.laravel.com).

For each assignment, you must make use of SOLID principles and unit test all your code. Unit testing documentation
with the lumen framework can be found on the [Testing section](https://lumen.laravel.com/docs/5.2/testing) of the
Lumen website.
